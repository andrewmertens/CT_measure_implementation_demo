# Demo of Computerized Cognitive Measures for Assessing Computational Thinking

This repository contains a demo of a [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) experiment, the full version of which was used to assess Computational Thinking skills in K-12 children (Mertens \& Colunga, in press).

To view this demo, open the python script from the PsychoPy application and run it from there (works on versions at least as recent as 2023.2.3).

The full version of this program uses measures adapted from existing cognitive batteries, namely the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children III (WISC-III) and the Leiter-R. More specifically, the full version includes computerized versions of the Block Design and Picture Arrangement subtests from the WISC-III and the Repeated Patterns and Sequential Order subtests from the Leiter-R. This demo includes trials representing the Block Design and Repeated Patterns subtests.

Note: Since the materials of the batteries used to create this program are proprietary, this demo substitutes the actual images from these measures with placeholder stimuli in order to how the computerized versions of these tasks were implemented.
